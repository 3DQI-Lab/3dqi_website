<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 has evolved into a global pandemic with ever-increasing health, economic and social impact. One pressing clinical challenge we are currently addressing at 3D Imaging Lab is to properly classify new patients according to quantifiable measures of disease severity so as to optimize healthcare resource utilization. We use our namesake freeware 3DQI to segment healthy tissues and pathological lesions in lungs, compute hundreds of radiomic features, and develop machine learning models to seek the most accurate answers to the clinical problems facing us.</p>
