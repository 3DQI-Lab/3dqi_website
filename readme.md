## Overview

This repository contains source code of the website for the 3D Quantitative Imaging Laboratory --- a research group at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The website is designed as fully client side and deployed on the Github Pages.

This documentation is a reference for website developers and designers.


## Getting Started

To test the website on the local machine:

+ Install Python 3.
+ Run the script `py/CustomWebserver.py` used to create a local server. Equivalently, on Windows, double-click the convenient batch script `run_webserver.bat` that invokes the Python script.
+ Open a web browser and enter `http://localhost:8000/`, which opens the `index.html` page.
